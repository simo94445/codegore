/*
* A C++ program is made up of objects, their accompanying member functions and global functions, which don't belong to any single particular class.
* Each function fulfills its own designated task, and can also call other functions, and even use these functions outputs as inputs.
* You can use ready-made functions from the standard library, or you can write them yourself. The main() function is necessary,
* as it's sort of the 'main program'.
